## basic example code

#    
#    Example of Print Divider package when used in Jupyter Lab.  The function 
#    call gs1() outputs a three-row Print Divider.  The third row will display  
#    the arguement used in the call and can be useful when used as a reference.
#
#
#   library(gs1)                         # Use library in Jupyter
#
#    
#
#   gs1(From ESS$Names)                 # Print-Divider call fnct with a note
#                                       # Output: Print Divider with a note
#
#   []                                                                                       
#   []  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX            
#   []    From ESS$Names
