This R package was build on the Windows platform and is designed to be used in the Windows environment.  To use this package, most people 
will be most familiar with downloading a compressed file and opening that file on their PC.

The gs1_0.1.0tar.gz file is the compressed R package. When opened, this compressed file will create the same folders and the files that 
can be viewed by opening the gs1 folder - the other file shown in this github repo.

The gs1 folder, when clicked and opened in this repo, shows the folder structure and the files associated with this R Package.  This folder and all the associated Package files will be reproduced in this exact form when this repo is cloned to the PC.  Cloning this folder will eliminated those unnecessary steps involved with opening the tar.gz compressed file.
